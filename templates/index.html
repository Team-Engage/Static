		<h1>Engage Static Design</h1>

    <p>Hello. This website / project is to sketch out the styling and UI without any of the backend clutter. The actual project itself uses both <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a> and <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/" target="_blank">Jinja2</a> to create an easy yet productive coding environment. Read more on this page, or use the navigation to look through some of the different sketches.</p>

    <h2>Project Setup</h2>

    <p>The actual project itself is set up into one main script, poetry config files, the docs folder (where the site is generated), the Sass folder, the templates folder, and the static folder. You can see the project files on <a href="https://github.com/Team-Engage/Static">Github</a>. It currently has two external dependencies, <a href="https://sass.github.io/libsass-python/">Libsass</a> and Jinja2.</p>
